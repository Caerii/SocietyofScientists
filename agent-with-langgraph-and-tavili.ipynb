AI empowered healthcare professionals\\\\\\\\nIn the longer term, healthcare professionals will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for example, clinicians could use an ‘AI digital consult’ to examine ‘digital twin’ models of their patients (a truly ‘digital and biomedical’ version of a patient), allowing them to ‘test’ the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the patient in the real world.\\\\\\\\n A recent review of AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015–2020 found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use.34 Studies have demonstrated AI\\\\\\'s ability to meet or exceed the performance of human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia), dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance comparable with that of cardiologists).35–38\\\\\\\\n For the NHS, the application of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data assets comprising the ‘highest levels of human knowledge’ to ‘work at the limits of science’ to deliver a common high standard of care, wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever.50 Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the world.\\\\\\\\n Artificial intelligence in healthcare: transforming the practice of medicine\\\\\\\\nJunaid Bajwa\\\\\\\\nAMicrosoft Research, Cambridge, UK\\\\\\\\nUsman Munir\\\\\\\\nBMicrosoft Research, Cambridge, UK\\\\\\\\nAditya Nori\\\\\\\\nCMicrosoft Research, Cambridge, UK\\\\\\\\nBryan Williams\\\\\\\\nDUniversity College London, London, UK and director, NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK\\\\\\\\nABSTRACT\\\\\\\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful and disruptive area of computer science, with the potential to fundamentally transform the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.who.int/news/item/28-06-2021-who-issues-first-global-report-on-ai-in-health-and-six-guiding-principles-for-its-design-and-use\", \"content\": \"Six principles to ensure AI works for the public interest in all countries\\\\\\\\nTo limit the risks and maximize the opportunities intrinsic to the use of AI for health, WHO provides the following principles as the basis for AI regulation and governance:\\\\\\\\nProtecting human autonomy: In the context of health care, this means that humans should remain in control of health-care systems and medical decisions;

AI empowered healthcare professionals\\\\nIn the longer term, healthcare professionals will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for example, clinicians could use an ‘AI digital consult’ to examine ‘digital twin’ models of their patients (a truly ‘digital and biomedical’ version of a patient), allowing them to ‘test’ the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the patient in the real world.\\\\n A recent review of AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015–2020 found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use.34 Studies have demonstrated AI\\'s ability to meet or exceed the performance of human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia), dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance comparable with that of cardiologists).35–38\\\\n For the NHS, the application of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data assets comprising the ‘highest levels of human knowledge’ to ‘work at the limits of science’ to deliver a common high standard of care, wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever.50 Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the world.\\\\n Artificial intelligence in healthcare: transforming the practice of medicine\\\\nJunaid Bajwa\\\\nAMicrosoft Research, Cambridge, UK\\\\nUsman Munir\\\\nBMicrosoft Research, Cambridge, UK\\\\nAditya Nori\\\\nCMicrosoft Research, Cambridge, UK\\\\nBryan Williams\\\\nDUniversity College London, London, UK and director, NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK\\\\nABSTRACT\\\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful and disruptive area of computer science, with the potential to fundamentally transform the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare.\", \\'score\\': 0.9704086, \\'raw_content\\': None}, {\\'title\\': \\'WHO issues first global report on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in ...\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.who.int/news/item/28-06-2021-who-issues-first-global-report-on-ai-in-health-and-six-guiding-principles-for-its-design-and-use\\', \\'content\\': \\'Six principles to ensure AI works for the public interest in all countries\\\\nTo limit the risks and maximize the opportunities intrinsic to the use of AI for health, WHO provides the following principles as the basis for AI regulation and governance:\\\\nProtecting human autonomy: In the context of health care, this means that humans should remain in control of health-care systems and medical decisions;

to assist with clinical care; strengthen health research and drug development, and support diverse public health interventions, such as disease surveillance, outbreak response, and health systems management.\\\\n They should be accompanied by training in digital skills, community engagement and awareness-raising, especially for millions of healthcare workers who will require digital literacy or retraining if their roles and functions are automated, and who must contend with machines that could challenge the decision-making and autonomy of providers and patients.\\\\n\\', \\'score\\': 0.9466954, \\'raw_content\\': None}, {\\'title\\': \\'Artificial Intelligence in U.S. Health Care Delivery\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra2204673\\', \\'content\\': \\'This article discusses the emerging use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains of health care delivery, such as image analysis, clinical decision making, and quality improvement.
