## Summary
A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing
scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering
previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach
that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to
organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs)
and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to
biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were
previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses
traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines
research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material
properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material
discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research,
and highlights their strengths and limitations. Our case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to
combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a ‘swarm
of intelligence’ similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and
accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature’s design principles
