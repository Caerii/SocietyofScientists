summary: Large language models (LLMs) are having a growing impact on society, particularly in the realm of textual information. This study analyzed over 30,000 papers and 1,000 presentations from machine learning conferences to examine how LLMs are influencing both written and spoken communication within the same community. The findings show that LLM-related words like "significant" are being used more frequently in abstracts and oral presentations. This suggests that the impact of LLMs on spoken communication is starting to emerge and is likely to increase in the future, highlighting the potential for LLMs to have a significant indirect influence on human society. 


summary: Large language models have shown remarkable emergent abilities, performing exceptionally well on diverse tasks they were not explicitly trained for, even those requiring complex reasoning. However, the emergence of these abilities is often confounded by competencies arising through in-context learning and instruction following, also prevalent in larger models. This study rigorously examines emergent abilities in a comprehensive set of 22 tasks across 18 models with parameter ranges from 60 million to 175 billion, through over 1000 experiments. Our findings indicate that emergent abilities can primarily be attributed to in-context learning, with no evidence of emerging reasoning abilities. This alleviates safety concerns and provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving these observed abilities. 


summary: This paper investigates the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. The authors found that current large language models are significantly undertrained, and that model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled in equal proportions. They trained a compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, which uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4× more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher, GPT-3, Jurassic-1, and Megatron-Turing NLG on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks.

summary: Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and

summary: Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.  Language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models.  Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pretraining Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.  Researchers have found that model scaling can lead to improved model capacity and that, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement, but also exhibit some special abilities (e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small-scale language models (e.g., BERT).  The research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size (e.g., containing tens or hundreds of billions of parameters).  This paper provides a survey of LLMs.

summary: Language modelling uses large repositories of written human knowledge to predict and understand the world. This paper analyzes Transformer-based language model performance across a range of scales, from tens of millions of parameters up to 280 billion parameters (in a model called Gopher). These models are evaluated on 152 diverse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across most. Gains from scale are largest in areas like reading comprehension, fact-checking, and identifying toxic language, but less so in logical and mathematical reasoning. The paper provides a holistic analysis of the training dataset and model's behavior, including its intersection with bias and toxicity. Finally, it discusses the application of language models to AI safety and mitigating downstream harms.

summary: Mixture of Experts (MoEs) layers enable efficient scaling of language models through conditional computation. This paper presents a detailed empirical study of how autoregressive MoE language models scale in comparison with dense models in a wide range of settings: in-and out-of-domain language modeling, zero-and few-shot priming, and full-shot finetuning. With the exception of fine-tuning, we find MoEs to be substantially more compute efficient. At more modest training budgets, MoEs can match the performance of dense models using ∼4 times less compute. This gap narrows at scale, but our largest MoE model (1.1T parameters) consistently outperforms a compute-equivalent dense model (6.7B parameters). Overall, this performance gap varies greatly across tasks and domains, suggesting that MoE and dense models generalize differently in ways that are worthy of future study. We make our code and models publicly available for research use. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), providing a highly useful, task-agnostic foundation for a wide range of applications. However, directly applying LLMs to solve sophisticated problems in specific domains meets many hurdles, caused by the heterogeneity of domain data, the sophistication of domain knowledge, the uniqueness of domain objectives, and the diversity of the constraints (e.g., various social norms, cultural conformity, religious beliefs, and ethical standards in the domain applications). Domain specification techniques are key to make large language models disruptive in many applications. Specifically, to solve these hurdles, there has been a notable increase in research and practices conducted in recent years on the domain specialization of LLMs. This emerging field of study, with its substantial potential for impact, necessitates a comprehensive and systematic review to better summarize and guide ongoing work in this area. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on domain specification techniques for large language models, an emerging research area with significant potential for impact. 


summary: This paper investigates whether language models can assess the validity of their own statements and anticipate which questions they can answer accurately. The authors demonstrate that larger models exhibit good calibration on diverse multiple-choice and true/false questions when presented in the appropriate format. This enables them to approach self-evaluation on open-ended tasks by having models first propose answers and then evaluate the probability of those answers being correct. 


summary: This paper systematically reviews the literature on large language models (LLMs), identifying key themes, impacts, and limitations. It examines the goals, methods, constraints, and future directions of LLM research, covering responsible development, algorithmic enhancements, ethical concerns, and societal implications. The paper provides a thorough overview of current LLM research and suggests potential avenues for future development, highlighting both the positive societal applications and the ethical considerations involved. 


summary: Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of generating persuasive political messages, raising concerns about their potential impact. This study examines the relationship between LLM size and persuasiveness, generating political messages from 24 models of varying sizes and testing them in a large survey experiment (N=25,982). The findings show that while larger LLMs are indeed more persuasive, this advantage is characterized by sharply diminishing returns.  In fact, the study found that the persuasiveness of current frontier models is only slightly greater than models much smaller in size. The study also suggests that the increased persuasiveness of larger LLMs might be primarily attributed to their improved ability to complete the task (e.g., coherence, staying on topic) rather than any inherent increase in persuasive power. Therefore, simply scaling model size may not significantly improve the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated messages. 


summary: This paper introduces Phi-3, a large language model (LLM) designed to run efficiently on mobile devices.

summary: This paper investigates the relevance of n-gram language models (n-gram LMs) in the age of neural large language models (LLMs). The authors argue that n-gram LMs are still valuable for both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. They demonstrate this by training an n-gram LM on a massive dataset of 5 trillion tokens, the largest n-gram LM ever built.  To overcome limitations of existing n-gram LMs with fixed, small n, the authors introduce an "infinity-gram" (∞-gram) LM with backoff.  This model enables the computation of probabilities for sequences of any length, utilizing a suffix array-powered engine called "infini-gram."  The authors then use this model to analyze both human-written and machine-generated text, finding that the ∞-gram LM has notable accuracy in next-token prediction and can significantly reduce the perplexity of neural LLMs. The analysis of machine-generated text reveals irregularities in the agreement between machine-generated text and the ∞-gram LM, suggesting potential deficiencies in the pretraining and positional embeddings of Transformers.

summary: Training large language models to follow instructions improves their performance on various tasks, making them more helpful. However, this can lead to models following even harmful instructions and generating unsafe content. This paper examines the safety of models that prioritize helpfulness over safety in instruction-tuning, finding that popular models are highly unsafe. The authors demonstrate that adding a small percentage of safety examples (3%) during fine-tuning significantly improves safety without compromising helpfulness. They also observe a phenomenon of "exaggerated safety" where excessive safety-tuning makes models refuse to respond to reasonable prompts that superficially resemble unsafe ones. This study highlights the trade-offs between training LLMs to follow instructions and ensuring safe behavior. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being trained to handle long contexts, but this presents challenges: limited availability of high-quality long-context data, potential for performance degradation on short-context tasks, and reduced training efficiency. This paper introduces Untie the Knots (UtK), a novel data augmentation strategy for the continued pre-training phase, designed to enable LLMs to gain long-context capabilities without altering the existing data mixture. UtK chunks documents, shuffles these chunks, and creates a complex, "knotted" structure of long texts. LLMs are trained to "untie" these knots, identifying relevant segments within seemingly chaotic token sequences. This approach significantly improves the model's ability to attend to relevant information in long contexts while boosting training efficiency. Experiments on models with 7B and 72B parameters, trained on 20 billion tokens, demonstrate that UtK achieves 75% and 84.5% accuracy on RULER at 128K context length, outperforming other long-context strategies. The trained models will be open-sourced for further research. 


summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are essential for tasks like text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts is resource-intensive. Existing solutions that add long context capabilities through fine-tuning or adaptations have design limitations. This paper presents Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for training long-context LLMs efficiently. FPDT enables a 16x increase in sequence length using the same hardware compared to existing methods. It allows training an 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while maintaining over 55% of MFU. FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and works efficiently across different LLM models. 


summary: Xmodel-LM is a 1.1B language model trained on a self-built dataset (Xdata) balancing Chinese and English corpora. Despite its small size, it surpasses existing open-source language models of similar scale. The model checkpoints and code are available on GitHub at this https URL. 


summary: This paper studies how language model performance on cross-entropy loss scales with model size, dataset size, and compute used for training. The loss scales as a power-law with all three factors, with trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details have minimal effects. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and training speed on model size. These relationships allow for the determination of the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, so the optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.

This demonstrates the potential of language models to outperform domain experts in important scientific tasks. 


summary: This research examines the reliability of large language models (LLMs) as they become larger and more instructable. While intuitive to assume that these improvements would lead to greater reliability, the study reveals that this isn't always the case. The authors find that as LLMs become more adept at complex tasks, their reliability on simpler tasks can decrease, leading to unpredictable and even reckless behavior. This issue stems from the fact that developers often prioritize "never evasive" models, which are encouraged to answer even when they lack confidence. The authors argue that understanding this reliability fluctuation is crucial for navigating the growing use of LLMs in various domains. 


summary: This paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) as the foundation for next-generation dense retrieval systems. It explores the benefits of LLMs over traditional retrieval methods and how different LLM configurations (size, pretraining duration, alignment) impact retrieval performance. The study, conducted on a diverse set of retrieval tasks, reveals that larger models and extensive pretraining consistently improve in-domain accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally, larger LLMs demonstrate significant potential in zero-shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction-based retrieval, and multi-task learning. The findings highlight the advantages of LLMs as versatile and effective backbones for dense retrieval, paving the way for future research and advancements in this field. 


summary: Language models have evolved from statistical to neural models, and recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. This survey focuses on large language models (LLMs), which are PLMs with significant size, and discusses their recent advancements.

It also summarizes available resources for developing LLMs and highlights future directions. 


summary: This paper examines the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding human language, arguing that while they excel at tasks like next-word prediction, they fall short in truly understanding semantics, compositionality, and other fundamental aspects of language. The authors discuss the limitations of LLMs, including their inability to grasp abstract concepts, common sense reasoning, and the "unspoken" knowledge inherent in human language. They also raise concerns about the potential for real-world harm caused by LLMs, highlighting issues related to data transparency, discrimination, and misinformation. The paper concludes that despite their impressive abilities, LLMs remain fundamentally different from organic computational systems, suggesting a potentially insurmountable gap between artificial and human language processing. 


summary: This paper investigates the optimal model size and number of training tokens for a transformer language model under a given compute budget. It was found that current large language models are undertrained due to the focus on scaling them while keeping the training data constant. The authors trained over 400 models with various parameters and data sizes, concluding that the model size and training tokens should be scaled equally for optimal training. To test this hypothesis, a compute-optimal model called Chinchilla was trained using the same compute budget as Gopher, but with 70 billion parameters and four times more data. Chinchilla consistently outperformed other large language models like Gopher, GPT-3, Jurassic-1, and Megatron-Turing NLG on a variety of downstream tasks. Chinchilla also uses less compute for fine-tuning and inference, making it more efficient for downstream usage. Notably, Chinchilla achieved a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, surpassing Gopher by 7%. 


summary: This paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to impersonate politicians and public figures. The study found that LLMs can generate responses to debate questions that are judged as more authentic and relevant than the original responses from the individuals they impersonated. This raises concerns about the potential for LLMs to manipulate public opinion and discourse. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) are promising for scientific knowledge creation and dissemination. However, their use in scientific writing is controversial due to concerns about authorship, originality, factual inaccuracies, and "hallucinations". While several publications prohibit LLMs, *NEJM AI* allows their use as long as authors take responsibility for the content and acknowledge LLM use. LLMs are not allowed as coauthors. This policy aims to enhance scientific work quality, democratize knowledge creation and consumption, and maximize the scientific workforce's ability to produce and disseminate robust, novel findings. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in communication, and this study investigates their impact on persuasion in the context of consumer complaints in the financial industry.

LLM usage was linked to increased persuasiveness in the complaints, leading to a higher chance of obtaining relief from financial firms. Computational linguistic analyses indicate that LLMs enhance various linguistic features, potentially aligning with diverse receiver preferences. Further experiments confirmed this hypothesis, highlighting LLMs' potential to transform human communication by boosting persuasiveness.

summary: It has been established that predictive models can be transformed into lossless compressors and vice versa. The authors argue that large language models, exhibiting impressive predictive capabilities, can be used as strong compressors. They evaluate the compression capabilities of these models, showing that they are powerful general-purpose predictors. The paper also explores how the compression viewpoint provides insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, surpassing domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%). Finally, the paper demonstrates that using any compressor (like gzip) can create a conditional generative model based on the prediction-compression equivalence. 


summary: This paper explores the challenges of using FP8 precision for training large language models (LLMs) on datasets with up to 2 trillion tokens. The authors discovered new instabilities in FP8 training, which they attribute to outlier amplification caused by the SwiGLU activation function. They propose Smooth-SwiGLU, a novel modification that addresses this issue and enables stable FP8 training. Additionally, they demonstrate the feasibility of quantizing both Adam optimizer moments to FP8, further enhancing training efficiency. By applying these innovations, the authors successfully trained a 7B parameter model using FP8 precision on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators, achieving comparable results to the BF16 baseline while providing up to a 34% throughput improvement.

summary: We introduce AudioPaLM, a large language model for speech understanding and generation. AudioPaLM fuses text-based and speech-based language models, PaLM-2 [Anil et al., 2023] and AudioLM [Borsos et al., 2022], into a unified multimodal architecture that can process and generate text and speech with applications including speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation. AudioPaLM inherits the capability to preserve paralinguistic information such as speaker identity and intonation from AudioLM and the linguistic knowledge present only in text large language models such as PaLM-2. We demonstrate that initializing AudioPaLM with the weights of a text-only large language model improves speech processing, successfully leveraging the larger quantity of text training data used in pretraining to assist with the speech tasks. The resulting model significantly outperforms existing systems for speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-speech generation.

summary: This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate novel research ideas. Through a study involving over 100 NLP researchers, the paper finds that LLM-generated ideas are considered more novel than those generated by human experts, though they are judged slightly weaker in terms of feasibility. The study identifies challenges in building and evaluating research agents, including LLMs' inability to accurately self-evaluate and their limited diversity in idea generation.  The paper suggests that human assessments of novelty can be subjective and proposes a future study design where researchers would execute generated ideas into full projects to evaluate their actual impact.

summary: The pre-training phase of large language models (LLMs) typically starts with random parameters, making training slow and expensive. This paper proposes HyperCloning, a method to initialize large LLMs using pre-trained smaller models.  HyperCloning expands the smaller model's parameters to match the larger model's increased hidden dimensions, allowing the larger model to inherit the smaller model's predictive power and accuracy before training even begins. This results in significant savings in GPU hours needed for pre-training large LLMs.

The study found that the appearance of LLMs led to a significant increase in the frequency of certain style words, suggesting that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This impact on academic writing is unprecedented, surpassing even the effects of major world events like the Covid pandemic.  


summary: The unprecedented performance of large language models (LLMs) necessitates improvements in evaluations. Rather than merely exploring the breadth of LLM abilities, we believe meticulous and thoughtful designs are essential to thorough, unbiased, and applicable evaluations. Given the importance of world knowledge to LLMs, we construct a Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment benchmark (KoLA), in which we carefully design three crucial factors: (1) For ability modeling, we mimic human cognition to form a four-level taxonomy of knowledge-related abilities, covering 19 tasks. (2) For data, to ensure fair comparisons, we use both Wikipedia, a corpus prevalently pre-trained by LLMs, along with continuously collected emerging corpora, aiming to evaluate the capacity to handle unseen data and evolving knowledge. (3) For evaluation criteria, we adopt a contrastive system, including overall standard scores for better numerical comparability across tasks and models and a unique self-contrast metric for automatically evaluating knowledge hallucination. We evaluate 21 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtain some intriguing findings. The KoLA dataset and open-participation leaderboard are publicly released at https://kola.xlore.cn and will be continuously updated to provide references for developing LLMs and knowledge-related systems. 


summary: This research explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to dynamically execute code written in human language. The goal is to enable programs to understand and act on natural language directives, instead of requiring traditional programming languages. The paper proposes a text editor that uses prompts and written language directives to generate application logic on the fly, eliminating the need for static executables. This approach has implications for user empowerment, security, and software development paradigms. 


summary: This study shows that multilingual large language models (LLMs) can be enhanced by providing them with parallel input in multiple languages (PiM). The researchers tested this by translating input into multiple languages and feeding it to LLMs, leading to improved comprehension. They found that using more languages in the PiM approach surpasses traditional in-context learning methods.  Interestingly, adding more languages actually inhibits neuron activation in the LLMs, suggesting a more precise activation pattern that aligns with the concept of synaptic pruning, a process that strengthens neural connections. 


summary: LokiLM is a 1.4B parameter large language model trained on 500B tokens. It performs well in natural language reasoning tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with 1.5B parameters or less. Despite its promising performance, LokiLM exhibits a concerning amount of hallucinations and scores poorly on the TruthfulQA benchmark, so the model is not publicly released. 


summary: This paper explores the emergent abilities of large language models. Emergent abilities are skills that appear in large models but not in smaller ones, meaning they cannot be predicted by simply scaling up smaller model performance. The authors argue that the existence of emergent abilities suggests that further scaling could lead to even more unexpected capabilities in language models. 


summary: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the merit of scientific ideas.

summary: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating grammatically correct, fluent text. However, despite their rapid emergence and intense debates about their capabilities, critical reflection lags behind. This paper examines critiques of LLM capacities, arguing that they need more nuance. It addresses three recurring criticisms: 1) LLMs merely parrot statistical patterns in training data, 2) they master formal but not functional language competence, and 3) their language learning cannot inform human language learning. The paper challenges these criticisms using empirical and theoretical arguments. Furthermore, it proposes a pragmatic perspective on the issue of "real" understanding and intentionality in LLMs, highlighting the potential for attributing mental states to LLMs under specific circumstances. This pragmatic approach provides a philosophical context for LLMs as they become increasingly integrated into society. 


summary: Reproducing research results in networking is crucial for both academia and industry. Current practices rely on public prototypes, contacting authors for private prototypes, or manual implementation. However, these methods are often limited due to the lack of readily available prototypes and the time-consuming, error-prone nature of manual implementation. This paper proposes a novel approach: leveraging large language models (LLMs) to reproduce network research results. An experiment is conducted with four students using ChatGPT to reproduce different networking systems published in prominent conferences and journals. The paper discusses the feasibility, observations, lessons learned, and future research directions related to this proposal.

The paper concludes by briefly discussing the relation between the cognitive skills acquired by LLMs and human cognition. 


summary: This paper introduces Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM), a new approach to evaluating the capabilities, limitations, and risks of language models. HELM focuses on improving the transparency of language models by: 1) Taxonomizing the vast space of potential use cases and metrics, 2) Adopting a multi-metric approach that measures 7 metrics across 16 core scenarios, and 3) Conducting a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models on 42 scenarios. HELM also provides a modular toolkit for adding new scenarios, models, metrics, and prompting strategies.  


summary: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is essential for modern clinical practice, but clinicians struggle to keep up with rapid medical advancements. This study explores the potential of AI, particularly Generative Large Language Models (LLMs), to address this information overload. The study curated real-world clinical cases and used various LLMs, including ChatGPT 3.5 and 4, Gemini Pro, and open-source models. LLMs were equipped with tools to retrieve information and make clinical decisions. GPT-4 demonstrated the most autonomous operation, effectively ordering investigations and conforming to guidelines. While limitations exist in handling complex guidelines, Retrieval Augmented Generation made more personalized recommendations. The study concludes that LLMs can function as autonomous EBM practitioners, utilizing tools to interact with healthcare infrastructure and perform guideline-directed patient management. Prompt engineering has the potential to further enhance this capability and transform healthcare for clinicians and patients.

summary: This paper explores the impact of large-scale language models (LLMs) on automated speech recognition (ASR) for YouTube videos, a source of long-form speech. The authors demonstrate significant improvements in ASR performance, achieving up to 8% relative reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) and up to 30% relative reduction in Salient Term Error Rate (STER) compared to a strong baseline using a maximum-entropy language model. They highlight the importance of lattice quality and contextual augmentation for long-form ASR, showing that the combination of LLMs trained on vast data and conventional neural language models yields additive performance gains. 


summary: This paper tests the hypothesis that large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can "morally self-correct" by avoiding harmful outputs if instructed to do so.  The authors find strong evidence for this hypothesis across three experiments, demonstrating that moral self-correction emerges at 22 billion model parameters and improves with increased size and RLHF training.  LLMs at this scale can follow instructions and learn complex harm concepts, allowing them to avoid producing morally harmful outputs. The authors suggest their results offer cautious optimism for training LLMs to abide by ethical principles. 


summary: Enriching datasets with demographic information (e.g., gender, race, age) from names is crucial in fields like healthcare and public policy.  Previous methods using hidden Markov models and neural networks have been limited by the lack of large, unbiased datasets.

summary: Many leading language models (LMs) use a lot of computing power both when they're learning and when they're used. This makes it hard to use them cheaply or quickly. To solve this, the paper introduces a new system called "Language Optimising Network Distribution" (LONDI). LONDI uses a small LM for most things, but calls on a large LM when complex decisions are needed. This way, it can solve hard problems without using a lot of computing power. The paper shows that LONDI learns which situations need a large LM and can solve tasks efficiently while saving up to 30% of the computer resources used. 


summary: This paper introduces MADLAD-400, a manually audited, general domain 3T token monolingual dataset based on CommonCrawl, spanning 419 languages. The paper discusses the limitations revealed by self-auditing MADLAD-400, and the role data auditing had in the dataset creation process. They then train and release a 10.7B-parameter multilingual machine translation model on 250 billion tokens covering over 450 languages, finding it competitive with significantly larger models. They also report results on different domains and train an 8B-parameter language model, assessing the results on few-shot translation. The baseline models are made available to the research community.

This approach offers a viable alternative for resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive use cases. 


summary: Fake news is a growing problem, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to both exacerbate and combat it. This paper explores the dual role of LLMs in fake news, investigating whether they can be used to generate biased content and whether they can be used to detect fake news. The authors analyze seven different LLMs and find that some models refuse to generate fake news, while others readily produce biased content. They also find that larger models perform better at detecting fake news, and that LLM-generated fake news is less likely to be detected than human-written fake news. The study concludes that LLMs can be valuable tools for combating fake news, but that their potential for misuse must be considered. 


summary: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate about their societal impacts, often focusing on potential biases and how to mitigate them. This is crucial, as AI can reinforce existing inequalities. However, it's equally important to explore how LLMs can positively promote equity.  Focusing solely on mitigating biases in LLMs without considering their potential for promoting equity might miss a critical opportunity to guide them towards positive societal impacts. This paper highlights four promising research directions for using LLMs to promote equity, acknowledging the associated risks and cautions. 


summary: Large language models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy across various tasks. However, efficiently training these models is difficult due to limitations in GPU memory and the vast number of computations needed. While tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed to address these challenges, they face scaling issues when used at thousands of GPUs. This paper presents a method for scaling tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism to thousands of GPUs. The authors introduce an interleaved pipelining schedule that enhances throughput by 10+% while maintaining a memory footprint comparable to existing approaches. This technique enables training a model with 1 trillion parameters at 502 petaFLOP/s on 3072 GPUs, achieving 52% of the theoretical peak per-GPU throughput. 


summary: This paper explores the potential influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) on human spoken communication. It examines a large dataset of transcribed videos from academic institutions and finds a significant shift in word usage, specifically words associated with ChatGPT, following its release. This suggests that humans are increasingly imitating LLMs in their spoken language, raising concerns about potential linguistic diversity reduction and misuse for manipulation. 


summary: This paper explores automated vulnerability patching using large language models (LLMs).  The authors introduce a new method called LLMPATCH, which utilizes adaptive prompting to enable LLMs to effectively reason about vulnerable code behaviors and generate patches without any test input or exploit evidence. LLMPATCH has shown superior performance in patching real-world vulnerabilities, including zero-day vulnerabilities, compared to existing prompting methods and non-LLM-based techniques. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) have shown their ability to understand human language using vast text data. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, often limited by transcribed speech data, benefit from a second pass rescoring using LLMs. This paper proposes novel techniques for using multi-modal LLMs, particularly speech and text foundational models, for ASR rescoring. They demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLMs can benefit rescoring, resulting in significant improvements over both Whisper large ASR and text-only LLM rescoring methods. 


summary: This paper argues that hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are not just occasional errors, but an inevitable feature of these systems. It draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem to demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs, making them impossible to eliminate through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. The authors introduce the concept of "Structural Hallucination" as an intrinsic nature of these systems, challenging the notion that hallucinations can be fully mitigated.
