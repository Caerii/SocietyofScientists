summary: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that can be used to enhance collective intelligence. They have the potential to help us solve complex problems, make better decisions, and be more creative. However, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with LLMs, such as bias and the potential for misuse. In this article, we explore the potential of LLMs to reshape collective intelligence. We discuss the various ways in which LLMs can be used to enhance human collaboration and creativity, and we consider the ethical and social implications of this technology. We argue that LLMs can be a powerful force for good, but that it is important to use them responsibly and thoughtfully. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly impacting human society, particularly in textual information. Based on more than 30,000 papers and 1,000 presentations from machine learning conferences, this study examined and compared the words used in writing and speaking. The results show that LLM-style words such as "significant" have been used more frequently in abstracts and oral presentations, suggesting an emerging impact of LLMs on both written and spoken communication. 


summary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated "emergent abilities" - exceptional performance on tasks they weren't explicitly trained for, including those requiring complex reasoning. However, these abilities may arise from in-context learning and instruction following rather than genuine reasoning. This study investigates emergent abilities in LLMs, controlling for potential biases. Rigorous tests on 18 models with varying parameters across 22 tasks revealed that emergent abilities can largely be attributed to in-context learning. The study found no evidence for the emergence of reasoning abilities, providing valuable insights into LLM capabilities and alleviating safety concerns. 


summary: This paper investigates the optimal model size and training data size for transformer language models, given a fixed compute budget. The authors find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, meaning they could benefit from more training data. They propose scaling the model size and the number of training tokens equally, doubling both for every doubling of model size. To test this hypothesis, they trained Chinchilla, a model with 70 billion parameters and 4 times more training data than Gopher (a model with 280 billion parameters). Chinchilla outperforms Gopher, GPT-3, Jurassic-1, and Megatron-Turing NLG on various tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the MMLU benchmark. The authors conclude that scaling model size and training data equally leads to better performance for a given compute budget. 


summary: In health, most large language model (LLM) research has focused on clinical tasks. However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into such tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring. Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiologic 


summary: Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and

summary: Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pretraining Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Since the researchers have found that model scaling can lead to an improved model capacity, they further investigate the scaling effect by increasing the parameter scale to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement, but also exhibit some special abilities (e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small-scale language models (e.g., BERT). To discriminate the language models in different parameter scales, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size (e.g., containing tens or hundreds of billions of parameters). Recently, the 


summary: This paper introduces LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on over 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. This approach tackles the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and mitigating common multilingual pitfalls. LOLA demonstrates competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks, and the learned expert-routing mechanism potentially alleviates the "curse of multilinguality" by exploiting implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns. The paper explores the training process, analyzes datasets, and examines the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA fosters reproducibility and serves as a strong foundation for future research, enabling the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with scalable performance across languages. 


summary: Language modelling provides a step towards intelligent communication systems by harnessing large repositories of written human knowledge to better predict and understand the world. In this paper, we present an analysis of Transformer-based language model performance across a wide range of model scales — from models with tens of millions of parameters up to a 280 billion parameter model called Gopher. These models are evaluated on 152 diverse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the majority. Gains from scale are largest in areas such as reading comprehension, fact-checking, and the identification of toxic language, but logical and mathematical reasoning see less benefit. We provide a holistic analysis of the training dataset and model’s behaviour, covering the intersection of model scale with bias and toxicity. Finally we discuss the application of language models to AI safety and the mitigation of downstream harms.
